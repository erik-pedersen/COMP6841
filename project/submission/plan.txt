Key things learnt:

	-What the hell PHP is
	-Basics of pwntools, gdb/pwndbg
	-ltrace and strace (so helpful!)
	-A little bit of x86 assembly
	-Some cool techniques e.g 'yes/no querying' (Natas15 --> Natas16)
	-XOR encryption (natas11)

Resources used:

	-Google, mostly lol
		-Like seriously, when learning new techniques/tools, I was mostly just Googling how to do things.
	-I did some narnia, and found https://shell-storm.org/shellcode/index.html quite helpful

Mindset changes:

	-Do not be afraid of looking at solutions. Sometimes you genuinely do not know.
	-Probing whatever you're trying to find an exploit can be very fruitful. Instead of rushing into doing technical things, just see if you can break the program with some weird inputs!
	-Don't be afraid to FAAFO (Mess around and find out) in the war games. I spent quite a bit of time just messing around with natas15 to see what I could do - it really helps you better understand what's going on, and might give some ideas for the future.

Tools I made:

	-I'm sure some things could be adapted to be more modular, they're all mostly for a particular war game at the moment.
		-That being said, I have become better at actually writing tools to solve problems - compare 
	 

What I want to do next:

	- Finish off Narnia and try out Behemoth
	- Try out some more hackthebox :)

Advice to my past self:
	
	- Manage time better. Spent more time on logbook than the project

Ideas for presentation:
	- Do one of the brute forces in the background while doing the presentation (might need to start early cause it's slow lol)
